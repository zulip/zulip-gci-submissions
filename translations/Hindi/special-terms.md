## Terms (शब्द)

* **Message** : संदेश , Message in this case is संदेश. There are other words
like समाचार and सूचना, but they mean news and information respectively.
Besides, संदेश is used in other contexts as well, and in all those contexts it
means message. , `user` को संदेश भेजें (Send message to `user`)
* **Private Message (PM)** : निजी संदेश (पीएम) , निजी is the first translation
we get while translating private. The other translations available (with
literal meaning in brackets) are: गैर-सरकारी (un-official, not the right word
 for zulip usage) ; व्यक्तिगत (personal, but the idea of private messages isn't
 about sharing personal stuff). , `user` को निजी संदेश भेजें (Send private
 message to `user`)
* **Group PM** : समूह निजी संदेश , समूह means group, but one meaning also given
 is team. Therefore group pm can be understood as a way to communicate with
 only the team members. , `Group name` में एक समूह निजी संदेश भेजें (Send a
 group private message to `Group name`)
* **Realm** : क्षेत्र , Realm translates to क्षेत्र but re-translating back to
English it becomes *area* or *regoin*. This means that switching between realms
 is like talking to different people in different areas, which is how realms
 work in Zulip. , किसी अन्य क्षेत्र में जाएं (Go to another realm)
* **Stream** : स्ट्रीम , Transliteration is used here as there is no way we can
 translate stream and get the exact same meaning as in the context of Zulip.
 धारा, प्रवाह, नदी, नाला, etc all represent different forms of flowing water
 and therefore cannot be used. , केवल `stream` से संदेश दिखाएं (Show only
 messages from `stream`)
* **Topic** : विषय , विषय means subject, but the other translations - प्रसंग
means context and प्रकरण means situation. Therefore विषय is used. , एक नए विषय
 को खोलें (Open a new topic)
* **Private/Invite-Only Stream** : निजी / केवल आमंत्रण स्ट्रीम , Literal
translation is used here, therefore there will be no confusion on any side
while this word is used. , अपने निजी / केवल आमंत्रण स्ट्रीम देखें (View your
private / invite-only stream)
* **Public Stream** : सार्वजनिक स्ट्रीम , सार्वजनिक literally means "For all
people", and public streams are also for all users. Therefore this translation
 is used. Other translations which are rejected are: प्रसिद्ध(famous), सामान्य
 (common), and प्रचलित(prevalent) , सार्वजनिक स्ट्रीम देखें (View public stream)
* **Bot** : बॉट , Transliteration used here. Translation is available for
"Robot" instead, but that translation literally means a humanoid, whereas bots
 in Zulip are just programs. , अपने बॉट देखें (See your bots)
* **Integration** : एकीकरण , एकीकरण to any average Hindi user would mean
something like unification, and since it is used in Zulip, it would mean
unifying Zulip with something. , फेसबुक के साथ जुलिप एकीकरण (Zulip integration
with Facebook)
* **Notification** : अधिसूचना , अधिसूचना is the easiest to understand
translation of "Notification" and it literally means "Before information/
Pre-information", which is basically what notifications are: Alerting the user
about a piece of information waiting for them. , अधिसूचनाएं बंद करो (Disable
notifications)
* **Alert Word** : सतर्क शब्द , चेतावनी,सावधान,भय which are translations of
alert are all related to being scared and as a result, alert. Therefore सतर्क
is used as a translation of alert. , अपने सतर्क शब्द देखें (See your alert
words)
* **View** : देखें , One translation of view is राय, but that means opinion.
Therefore the formal translation of see is used here , न पढ़े हुए पोस्ट
देखें (View unread posts)
* **Home** : मुख्य पृष्ठ , Translation of homepage is used here with a slight
modification. मुख पृष्ठ(home page) literally means face page or front page,
usually associated with books and magazines. Therefore मुख्य पृष्ठ is used
which means "Main page" , मुख्य पृष्ठ पर जाएं (Go to the home page/Go home)
* **Emoji** : इमोजी , Transliteration used here, as there are no possible
translations for "emoji". Also the common Hindi folk is familiar with the
English word and therefore using transliteration shouldn't be a problem ,
इमोजी शैली बदलें (Change emoji style)

## Phrases (वाक्यांश)

* **Subscribe to a stream/Unsubscribe from a stream** : किसी स्ट्रीम की
सदस्यता लें / एक स्ट्रीम से सदस्यता समाप्त करें , There is no direct word for
"Subscribe" in Hindi, but the translator result means "Take a subscription".
Similarly the result of "Unsubscribe" means "End a subscription". Both of these
 translations are used here , `stream` की सदस्यता लें / सदस्यता रद्द करें
 (Subscribe to / Unsubscribe from `stream`)
* **Narrow to** : द्वारा संकुचित करें , The translation of "Narrow by" is used
 instead of "Narrow to", which when translated means "physically narrow an
 object to something", which cannot be used in this context , इस विषय द्वारा
 संकुचित करें (Narrow to this topic)
* **Filter** : फ़िल्टर , One available translation of filter is छन्ना, but it
literally means a strainer. Therefore translitration is used here. , फ़िल्टर
हटाए (Remove filters)
* **Mute/Unmute** : म्यूट / अनम्यूट , Transliteration is used here as well as
translation of mute will give results which mean mute, but in the context as a
 person who cannot speak. , इस `stream` को म्यूट / अनम्यूट करें (Mute / unmute
 this `stream`)
* **Deactivate/Reactivate** : निष्क्रिय करें / पुन: सक्रिय करें , These two
words are direct translations and there is no alternative translation to
either of them which we can use in Zulip as they are long phrases , अपने खाते
को निष्क्रिय / पुनः सक्रिय करें (Deactivate / reactivate your account)
* **Search** : खोज , खोज is used in many search engines as well, and is a well
known word. Other translations like तलाश and जाँच are used in the context of
security, where people are searched, therefore cannot be used here. , आपने
`search item` के लिए खोजा (You searched for `search item`)
* **Pin** : पिन , Transliteration used here as well for two reasons:
Translations of pin mean all different kinds of needles and the like, and to
convert to verb form we can just add करो. , इस पोस्ट को पिन करें (Pin this post)
* **Mention/@mention** : उल्लेख / @ उल्लेख , उल्लेख is used as it is the common
 translation of the word and sounds formal. Another translation, कथन is more
 often associated with quoting from a story. , उपयोगकर्ता का उल्लेख करें
 (Mention user)
* **Invalid** : अमान्य , We can use the translation of "incorrect" here, but
this translation means "unacceptable", which is better as we are not able to
accept the input, but it need not mean the input is wrong , बॉट का नाम अमान्य
है (Bot name is invalid)
* **Customization** : अनुकूलन , Possibly the only translation available. Trying
 to translate "customize" also returns a form of this word itself. , अपने
 अनुकूलन देखें (See your customization)
* **I want** : मुझे `something` चाहिए , Just like Marathi and other Indian
languages, the sentence formation follows the pattern: `subject object action`.
 Therefore if there is an object, it should come between मुझे and चाहिए , मैं
 एक मेल भेजना चाहता हूं (I want to send a mail)
* **User** : उपयोगकर्ता , Like subscribe, the translation of user is from the
root word उपयोग , which means use. Therefore उपयोगकर्ता means the one who uses
 , उपयोगकर्ता को खोजें (Search user)
* **Person/People** : व्यक्ति / लोग , Like Marathi, the singular and plural
forms are totally unrelated to each other. Also, they are the most common/
formal translations that can be used , इस विषय पर चर्चा करने वाले लोग देखें
(See people discussing this topic)

## Other (अन्य)

* **You** : आप , Note that you can be also translated as तुम, but that is used
in informal contexts. No other words are available for normal use besides those
 two. , हम आपको एक मेल भेज देंगे (We will send you a mail)
* **We** : हम , Only translation of we, the other translations are just the
root word and the suffixes added so that it means "we all" or "we people",
 which is unnecessary in Zulip , हम आपके खाते को जल्द ही शामिल करेंगे (We will
 add your account soon)
