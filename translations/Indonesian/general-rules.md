# General Rules

## Should translations be formal or informal?
Translations should be formal. One of the reason is because other social networks use formal style, informal translations may not sound friendly.
**Example:** The word "Delete" can be translated into "Hapus" (formal) or "Buang" (informal). But "Buang" sounds a bit rude, I prefer using "Hapus".

## Which grammatical person should be used for translations (e.g. second person singular, first person plural)?
Use grammatical person as appropriate to the language. First person singular and second person singular is mostly used, the rest are rarely used.

## What verbs should be used (e.g. active, imperative, continuous)?
It depends, but translations mostly use imperative and active verbs.
**Active verb example:** "Ubah" (Change).
**Imperative verb example:** "Berikan" (Give).
**Continuous verb example:** "Memuat" (Loading).
Indonesian continuous verbs usually starts with "men-".

## What types words or phrases should not be used (e.g. slang, regional)?
Slang or regional words and phrases should not be used.
Regional word example: "Naon" (Sundanese) = "Apa" (Indonesian) = "What" (English)
Slang word example: "Doang" (Indonesian slang) = "Hanya" (Indonesian) = "Only" (English)
Why shouldn't they be used? 
Regional words: Because it may confuse some people, Over 300 different native languages are spoken in Indonesia, and not everyone can speak fluently in 300 languages.
Slang words: Because it may sound too rude and may be too informal.

## Consistent usage of Zulip-specific terms and common verbs for actions
This is important. Most websites that are translated to Indonesian are always formal. (e.g. "beranda" (home), "utama" (primary))

## Mindful usage of long words and phrases to keep frontend working properly
Shorter words are better sometimes, but can be informal.
**Example:**
Send - "Kirim" (formal) is shorter than "Antarkan" (informal)
Notification - "pemberitahuan" (formal) is longer than "laporan" (informal)

## Balancing common verbs and nouns with specific IT-related translation of English terms
This is tricky. But instead, we can look at examples from other websites that have Indonesian translations. (e.g. GMail, Facebook, Twitter)
