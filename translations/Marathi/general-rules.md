# General Rules for Translation in Marathi

## Overview

* Marathi is a very versatile & easy-to-use language like English, so translations
  are also easy.

* Translations can be done in either way, formal or informal, but formal way is preferred
  for corporate work.

* The translations can be done in any person (first, second or third) according to the 
  content one wants to translate.
   (For Zulip, First Person Translation is recommended, as it makes understanding easy.)

* Same is applicable for singular & plural, the translations depend upon the type of content.

* The usage of verbs & nouns is similar to English, the type of the verb & the noun used changes
  according to the construction of the sentence & the content, so there are no such rules 
  for verbs & nouns.

* The usage of particles (e.g. reflexives) again depends upon the sentence, so their is no 
  restriction on their usage.

* Slang words (especially abusive words) should not be used while translations.

* Long Words are very uncommon in Marathi (especially Zulip-specific), so the translations
  are easy & quick.
* There is no specific way of addressing people in Marathi, it can be done in any way (formal 
  or informal), but Formal way is suggested for Zulip.
   (Also, personal pronouns can be used freely, there is no restriction or convention.) 
  e.g.
  1. Formal: 'Please send me a message' can be formally translated into - 'कृपया मला एक संदेश पाठवा'
  2. Informal: 'Please send me a message' can be informally translated into - 'मला एक संदेश पाठव' 

* Capitalization is not done in Marathi in any form, as there are no uppercase & lowercase 
  in the language.
  
* Other grammatical elements (such as gerunds) are used again according to the content,
  just like it is done in English.

* Translation of Zulip-specific terms & common verbs is also very easy in Marathi.
  e.g,
  1. The Word 'topic' is called 'विषय' in Marathi.
  2. The verb 'check' is called 'तपास' in Marathi.
  3. The sentence 'Please check the pull request' translates to - 'कृपया पुल अनुरोध तपासा' (Recommended)
     <br>
     The above sentence can also be translated as - 'पुल अनुरोध आणखी एकदा बघा' (Informal Translation)
