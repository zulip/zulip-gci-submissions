# Notifications (Part 1)

### Review User Guides On:
 - Mute a stream
 - Mute a topic
 - Set notifications for a single stream
 - Desktop notifications
 - Audible notifications

The procedures and user experience for all the above operations is pretty straight forward.
The key is then simplicity: we don't want to over complicate the steps for a simple task.
I did all the listed operations on a local dev instance in Linux Mint 18.3 Cinnamon, by following all the guides word by word.


### Breakdown:
#### Mute a stream
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/mute-a-stream)
The documentation for this operation is short and precise. I didn't really face any problems nor had any questions. Some minor notes:  
 - I didn't really like the `eye` icon for muting the stream, usually it resembles a speaker with/without sound coming from it. 
 - The `step 2` uses parenthesis `()` instead of angular brackets `<>` to denote the stream name. Eg: It should be `Mute the stream <stream name>` instead of `Mute the stream (stream name)`.

#### Mute a topic

The documentation for this operation is short and well segmented. All different types of "Mutings" were segregated in different sections. I have the same minor suggestion about the use of angular brackets insted of parenthesis and the icon of a speaker instead of an eye. (Eye generally denotes visibility of a particular thing like layers in Adobe Photoshop not the action of muting)

#### Set notifications for a single stream
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/set-notifications-for-a-single-stream)
The documentation was easy to understand, accurate and crisp. Perfect.

#### Desktop notifications
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/configure-desktop-notifications)
The documentation was the same in quality and accuracy as the previous operation. Perfect.

#### Audible notifications
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/configure-audible-notifications)
The documentation was the same in quality and accuracy as the previous operation. Perfect.

### Conclusion:
Overall, I found the documentation ideal, easy to understand, crisp, and short. I had no problems performing the operations listed above. The only suggestion I am able to make is again, the Icon for muting, and the use of `<>` instead of `()` for denoting situational conditions.

PS: The consistency throught the documentation is quite remarkable specially at such a scale.
