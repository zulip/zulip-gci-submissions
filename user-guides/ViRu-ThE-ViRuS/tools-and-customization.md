# Tools and Customization

### Review User Guides On:
 - Bots and integrations
 - Enable high contrast mode
 - Display the buddy list on narrow screens
 - View organization statistics

The procedures and user experience for all the above operations is pretty straight forward.
The key is then simplicity: we don't want to over complicate the steps for a simple task.
I did all the listed operations on a local dev instance in MacOS High Sierra, by following all the guides word by word.

### Breakdown:
#### Bots and integrations
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/add-a-bot-or-integration)
The documentation steps for this operations are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. The screenshots are outdated though (both of them). They need to updated otherwise the user will think that he/she is doing something wrong. Also there is no mention of how to edit or delete bots. There should be somekind of tip/link to the appropriate page to do this. I also think that the bot types/info should be above the steps to make them.
I had a question: How many bots can a user add?

#### Enable high contrast mode
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/enable-high-contrast-mode)
The biggest problem on this page is **THE SPELLING MISTAKE IN "PRACTISES"** right on the second line. I have no other suggestions/questions as the steps are easy to follow and concise. There can also be a mention of the Night Mode.

#### Display the buddy list on narrow screens
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/move-the-users-list-to-the-left-sidebar)
The steps are easy to follow and concise. The one suggestion I can make is to put the `then reload the page ...` to its own step ie. step 3.

#### View organization statistics
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/analytics)
`over a point of time` should be `over a period of time` according to me. There are no steps to actually see the stats, just a link to the page where they can be found (this was the only question I had for this operation). The rest of the documentation is well segregated and informative. But the page is quite long in my opinion.

### Conclusion:
The documentation for this set of operations is not as good as some I have seen like the Notifications operations. The spelling mistake needs to be fixed immediately (mentioned above) for obvious reasons. The rest of the suggestion, though optional, might improve the user's experience to some extent.
