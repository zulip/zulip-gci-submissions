# Notifications (Part 2)

### Review User Guides On:
 - Email notifications
 - Mobile notifications
 - Digest emails
 - Add an alert word

The procedures and user experience for all the above operations is pretty straight forward.
The key is then simplicity: we don't want to over complicate the steps for a simple task.
I did all the listed operations on a local dev instance in Linux Mint 18.3 Cinnamon, by following all the guides word by word.

### Breakdown:
#### Email notifications
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/configure-email-notifications)
The documentation for this operation is short and precise. Perfect.

#### Mobile notifications
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/configure-mobile-notifications)
The documentation for this operation is quite useful. I make a suggestion to actually give a discription of this kind of notification before the steps like in the one above.

#### Digest emails
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/configure-email-digest-notifications)
The documentation was easy to understand, accurate and crisp. Perfect.

#### Add an alert word
[Link.](https://zulipchat.com/help/configure-desktop-notifications)
The documentation is short and sweet. The screenshot provided is relavent and clear. The `tips` present extra information in an attractive and neat way. The one suggestion I make is rather a small one, that is to crop the screenshot provided to make the relavent protion (the message) is what comes to primary focus.
Furthermore the `step 4` is not actually a step and should  be preset and postscript/after the steps (seperately).

### Conclusion:
I do have a suggestion for the actual Notification Settings Panel in Zulip. The sub-settings in the Notification Tab ie. the settings like `Include content of private messages` and `Mobile notifications always (even when offline)` are less than ideal. The reasons:
 - They are not visually appealing. It appears that these options are just misaligned, where it should appear that they are actual modifiers to the above settings. They just provide inconsistency and untidiness to the panel.
 - They are bad in the long term. As the number of options available will grow in the future, these settings will start getting more and more untidy. Further what if sub-sub-settings are added?

The suggested solutions:
 - Offer a hierarchy/tree type menu like those in file/solution explorers to simplify the UI/UX and make it feasible to expand on easily.
 - Click to expand UI or a dropdown UI.

The documentations for the listed operations are quite appropriate in my opinion and thus I have no major  suggestions on them. I was able to follow them without and doubts and made efficient use of my time. All the suggestions I make are on the formatting and Ui/UX side of things.

PS: The consistency throught the documentation is quite remarkable specially at such a scale.
