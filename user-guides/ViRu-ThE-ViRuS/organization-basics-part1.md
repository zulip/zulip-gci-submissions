# Tools and Customization

### Review User Guides On:
 - Change your organization name
 - Change your organization description
 - Change your organization avatar
 - Change your organization's settings
 - Link to our Zulip from the web

The procedures and user experience for all the above operations are pretty straightforward.
The key is then simplicity: we don't want to over complicate the steps for a simple task.
I did all the listed operations on a local dev instance in MacOS High Sierra, by following all the guides word by word.

### Breakdown:
#### Change your organization name

The steps for this operation are easy to follow and short. I only recommend showing how to access the `Manage Organization` page in this page itself. It currently requires navigating to a whole new page.

#### Change your organization description

Same recommendations as the last one. A short description on how to access the `Manage Organization` page will save the daily user a click. The steps otherwise are concise and accurate.

#### Change your organization avatar

Same recommendations as the last one. The steps otherwise are easy to follow and I don't have any questions. It would be nice to specify all (if any) specifications about the avatar image like size and format.

#### Change your organization's settings

The `Manage Organization` option in the dropdown menu from step 1 is called the `Organization settings` in the current version of Zulip. This needs to update as a user might get confused. Step 3 is not necessarily a step as such.

#### Link to your Zulip from the web

The documentation for the operation is short, concise and easy to follow. I have no questions/suggestions.

### Conclusion:
The documentations for the listed operations were easy to follow and concise. The minor suggestions I make may potentially improve the user experience. The need to update `Manage Organization` tab to `Organization settings` tab is quite necessary though.
