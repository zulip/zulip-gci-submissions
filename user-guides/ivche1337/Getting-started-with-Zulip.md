# Getting-started-with-Zulip

The documentation is descriptive,
and it explains that Zulip tries to achieve,
and everything you need to start using zulip

It isn't overwhelming, and the keybindings are well explained,
and it is easy to follow through.

I didn't have any issues regarding the tutorial,
I followed through it, and everything was briefly explained.
