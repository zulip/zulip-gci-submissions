Stream management


- Delete a stream
- Set default streams for new users
- Rename a stream
- Change a stream's description
- Change the privacy of a stream
- Add someone to a stream
- Remove someone from a stream

For all of the topics above the UI is pretty straight forward,
I didn't face any problems or difficulties testing the actions
and i didn't have any questions while doing so.

The screenshots provided bu the /help/ section, looked the same
as my dev instance, so no problem there.

Also the documentation is well written and descriptive,
so users shouldn't have any problem while trying to do a certain action
from the actions listed above.
