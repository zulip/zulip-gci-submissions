   linked to the app is layed out well.

   and i didn't have any problem.

   * Logging on is well explained, and the screenshot matches the prompt from my phone
   * I tried every feature like
     - Sending a stream message
     - Sending a private message
     - Replying to a message
     - Narrowing to a stream
     - Narrowing to a topic
     - Filtering messages
