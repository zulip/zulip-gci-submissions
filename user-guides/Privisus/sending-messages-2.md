Reviewing user guides: Sending Messages, Part 2
=====

In this document, I reviewed the following:

* Emoji
* Video calls
* Share and upload files
* Manage your uploaded files
* Enable pressing Enter to send
* Verify a message was sent
* Status messages

Emoji
-----

Introduction looks good. So moving on.

Adding a figure is optional for the steps, but it is useful for the beginner
users for easier navigation

On the tip, where the user can browser "Unicode Consortium's full list of
emoji". It is better to tell the user which part of the emoji the user can and
cannot copy from the table (is copying the emoji from the Browser column any
different from copying it from the GMail one?)

Remind the user that the emoji will only appear after the user actually have
sent it

Video calls
-----

It lacks introduction, but it is straight to the point. Which is no problem for
me personally.

Step 1 can be "simplified" for the user by just pressing `c` or `r`, 
So rephrasing it to "Press `c` or `r` to compose a new message 
or reply" should be more effective and efficient (instead of redirecting the
user to another article. This can also prevent that annoying moment when the
article redirects you to another article, which redirects you again to another
article in order to do the previous article, etc. You can see the pattern here
).

Step 3 is not actually a step, it is just an information. I suggest not
numbering it so the next steps are shifted by 1. Speaking of this, it is also
convenient to explain why `[Click to join video call](https://link.here)` is
considered a *link*. Remind the user that the user can just also not use the
format and just put the plain link, but it is more easy for the eyes to see if
the user uses the format.

Step 4, which is "Send the message", Well.. I don't know how to feel about
this. Let's just say that I prefer "Press `send` or `enter` to send the 
message" more than just "send the message".

Share and upload files
-----

Introduction looks great, so moving on.

The important thing to notice that it explains about the markdown's link
format, instead of the previous article, which just say "do this and that". And
I personally like this style of explanation because it is descriptive and it
leaves no ambiguity to the user.

More on sending a .gif file should be informed. Will the .gif automatically
turn into another static image? Will it stay the same, but only with a static
thumbnail? Will it also move?

Minor suggestion to remove the paranthesis of "(and not downloaded)" and change
it to become "but not downloaded" (**Link Behavior**, last sentence). I
personally think the flow is better thay way.

More documentation is needed for unsupported preview from external websites if
possible. This is to make sure that *maybe*, just *maybe* there is someone who
can fix the issue.

Manage your uploaded files
-----

Introduction part is not needed as it doesn't tell anything informative or new
to the user.

Looking at the first screenshot, which locates below "All of your uploaded
files are displayed in the following format:", it is amazing. This is how you
document. This is what I expect when I say "I want an informative figure, 
complete with helpful marks". You can clearly see what is going in with 
the figure and the information beneath it. It doesn't just exists there 
independently. They show a clear connection between one another.

This really shows, because when I read the next tip, I immediately know what do
do and how to do it. I can locate message ID and the timestamp easily, even
though the tip is just one sentence.

It is recommended to document what happens to the other user when the user
deletes their own file. Does it still exists? If the other user has downloaded
the file, does it still dissapear on their own chat? Can the other user still
see their own downloaded file, or does it also get deleted?

Enable or disable Press Enter to send
-----

I assume this article uses a more long and detailed approach of doing specific
things. So I will treat it that way.

The introduction looks good and all, but the steps aren't clearly shown. It is
just diffused with the introduction.

I personally think it is better to just show the steps separately instead of
combining it into the introduction paragraph. I suggest turning the steps in
the paragraph (if any), into a numbered step. Putting a screenshot can also add
a nice touch to it, but it is optional.

Verify that your message has been successfully sent
-----

The first thing that came to my mind when reading this article was: "is this a
developer documentation?". The normal user (or even the administrator) doesn't
really care about how this process works (first, second, and a little bit of
third paragraph). I suggest moving it into the dev documentation because it is
more appropriate in there.

I suggest rewriting the three paragraph introduction into a shorter one. It's
just not worth it reading something that *isn't* actually helping the user to
"Verify that your message has been successfully sent". The third paragraph is
actually fine by itself though, so maybe consider that.

Step 3 isn't actually telling the user to do something. It just informs the
user about what to expect. I suggest not numbering this step so the next steps
are shifted up by 1.

I suggest stating where the location of the timestamp actually is
("...timestamp on the right side of the message body, **as shown in the
screenshot below, marked by the red box.**").

Status messages
-----

This redirects the page to **Format messages using Markdown**. 
See sending-messages-1.md for the review on "Format messages using 
Markdown".

Otherwise, the **Status Messages** subsection is explained pretty well. I 
have nothing to say here.
