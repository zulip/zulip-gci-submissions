# Zulip Google Code-In Submissions Repository

This is a repository for student submissions in Zulip's Google Code In, 
an awesome high school program where students compete by making contributions
participating open source projects. Zulip has 
[a separate repo](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci) for holding documentation, 
and task descriptions. This repo is where we store contributions that don't yet 
have a place in the other Zulip repositories. If you want to get started contributing, 
try making your 
[first pull request](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-gci/blob/master/tasks/2017/submit-a-pull-request.md)
to this repo.
