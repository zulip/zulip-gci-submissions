Hello! This is Abijith10. 

Issues I faced:
1. Writing the unit test was the biggest hurdle for me. As I was new to programming I couldn't write the test on my own.
Thanks to Robert HÃ¶nig for helping me here.

Other than these errors I didn't face many issues. And special thanks to Xavier for helping in running the test.
