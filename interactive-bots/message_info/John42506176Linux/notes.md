1. The biggest error I had with this assignment was that in the demo code, it was never specified whether to keep both methods or not. 
2. I eventually chose to keep only the send_message function and drop the send_reply, because the check_expected_responses message only seemed to work for only one of the functions , send_message and send_reply
3. I was using python2 instead of python3 for my virtualenv and it costed a lot of errors.
4. Updated to Python3
5. check_expected_responses function was not in the StubBotTestCase clas provided. 
6. Changed class from StubBotTestCase to BotTestCase
