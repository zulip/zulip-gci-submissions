Note down any places you got stuck, problems or errors you ran into while
doing this setup process.

> I haven't managed to get the Zulip development environment working on my
Windows computer, and I've decided to try to run it in an Ubuntu VM, but
until I figure that out, I have to use Codeanywhere, which most mentors
aren't familiar with. I still haven't managed to figure it out yet and just
decided to give up and do everything from the terminal.

> Apparently I lack a lot of common sense because I forgot to activate the
bot development environment twice. But that's my problem :)

> I also received a StateHandlerError, but it turns out my zulip_bots
package was just outdated and I had to fetch changes and re-run tools/
provision. I feel like this is probably a common error, so maybe it's worth
noting in the instructions?
