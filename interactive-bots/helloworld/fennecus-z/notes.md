The only actual problem I encountered was in the running of the zuliprc file, no matter how many times I referenced the path correctly, I kept getting an error, which is in the PNG titled Error. Eventually, I was able to get it to work by moving the zuliprc file directly to the zulip folder. 

Thanks for reading!
