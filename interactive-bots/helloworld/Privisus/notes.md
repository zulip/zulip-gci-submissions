I encountered a rather confusing error (at first) when doing ./tools/provision, which told me that I was running an outdated version of Python (2.7). I have both 2.7 and 3.5, so I didn't want to force the installation. Fixing this should be trivial, but it took an embarassing amount of time for me to figure it out. Eventually I did `python3 ./tools/provision` and everything went fairly smooth from here.
