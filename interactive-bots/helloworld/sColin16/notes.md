Problems Faced:
===============

1. **The scp command** was researched to transfer the bot configuration file into my Zulip dev env.

2. **Two consoles** were required to run both the bot and the Zulip dev env at the same time.

3. **Git branch commands** were reviewed to push the files to the appropriate branches.

4. **Basic markdown syntax** was learnt to make this note page more visually appealing :smile:

Screenshot Notes
================
* **Zulipbot-responses.png** - Demonstrates the helloworld bot responding to the messages sent to it.

* **Zulipbot-running.png** - Demonstrates the commands used to run the helloworld bot in the console.
