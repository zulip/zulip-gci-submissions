Hello!
This is Abhinav, this is my first task for Zulip.
I faced difficulties while using the command line as I have never done it before. 
I also faced issues while trying to use Vagrant, so I switched to DigitalOcean.
While interacting with the HelloWorld bot, I typed the message before the name of the bot, the bot did not reply to this. I checked the logs and then I realized that the message comes after the name.
