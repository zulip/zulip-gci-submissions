The Notes for my helloworld bot

This is the helloworld bot that I have made for Zulip for the Interactive Bots Part 1 GCI task. Throughout the task, there was only one time where I got stuck, but with some help from the Zulip community I managed to fix the issue.

The problem I had was the ./tools/provision command wouldn't run and came up with an error saying there was no such file or directory called "python". It turned out that I hadn't installed Python correctly so it wasn't added to my PATH and couldn't be recognised as a command.

Apart from that issue, I had no other problems with the task and really enjoyed the task.
