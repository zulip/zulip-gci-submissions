**Some problems I faced and was able to tackle effectively:**

- I had to run ./tools/provision to update the zulip local development server after I had updated the repository. I got the hint to do this when I ran ./tools/run-dev.py, it told me that my repository had been updated and I needed to run this command. I didn't find any instructions about this on the zulip api website.

- I am running the zulip local development server on a virtual Linux Mint machine. I had troubles setting up the dev environment as the localhost in virtual box is not accessible. I followed this guide, which got me up and running: [Address local host from a Virtual Box Virtual Machine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1261975/addressing-localhost-from-a-virtualbox-virtual-machine)
