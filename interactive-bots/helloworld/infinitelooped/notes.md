**My issues**

I got stuck trying to figure out why my virtualenv is always with Python 2, 
since I have both Python 2 and 3. If I try to run the bot using Python 2, it 
would cause a syntax error, so I need to find a way so that I can run it with 
Python 3.

It wasn't long until I read the script's explanation saying the Python 
version of the virtualenv is same as the Python version that executes it. So I 
execute it with Python 3 and all worked as expected.
