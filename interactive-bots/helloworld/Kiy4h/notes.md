# Notes


When I follow the tutorial given in https://zulipchat.com/api/writing-bots#installing-a-development-version-of-the-zulip-bots-package, I got a bit confused in step 4 because my console says `(zulip-api-py3-venv) ~/zulip/python-zulip-api (master)`, while the tutorial says that it should be something like `(ZULIP-~1)`.

I also messed up running the command `tools/run-dev.py` in the right directory.

Then I followed this tutorial: https://zulipchat.com/api/running-bots#running-a-bot I was stuck at step 3 because I thought that I should move the `zuliprc` file through the running Zulip bots development environment instead of a new Git Bash window.
