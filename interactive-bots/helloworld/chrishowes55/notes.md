# Problems and Errors
* I had trouble with running zulip-run-bot, because I tried to run the name of the bot I had created instead of hello world (so it was zulip-run-bot chrishoweshelloworld ... instead of zulip-run-bot helloworld)
* I also had trouble for a long time trying to test on the UI because I was trying to use a bot created on the zulip account that I had created for the actual website, as opposed to the localhost account
