Hey! This is Abijith, an aspiring programmer and GCI student at Zulip. This is a note on the task interactive bots. And I am asked to note down the places where I was struck. I was struck at multiple places thankfully mentors helped the most when I needed. I will list down the places where I was struck.

Problem 1:
The failed message in ./tools/provison

Issue: 
The issue was that I wasn't adding the prefix python3

Problem 2: 
I was stuck in running zulip-run-bot

Issue:
1. It wasn't using python3 
2. Problem with the localhost which I had to rebase again under the guidance of Alena and Vishnu. :)

These were the major problems I faced during my task on "Interactive bots", all these are resolved and I have added the respective screenshots of it. It wouldn't have been possible without all the support by the mentors present there, hence I am thanking them again for helping me to fullfil the task.
