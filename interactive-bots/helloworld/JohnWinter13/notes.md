Since I was doing this from a remove VM, I had some trouble figuring out how to get the zuliprc there. I was able to fix this by using Codeanywhere to add the file there. I also had some trouble setting up the worksapce on Codeanywhere, but Tommy lp helped me on the Zulip GCI help stream and told me to change the port to 22 and the username to zulipdev. I was able to get everything working afterwards.
