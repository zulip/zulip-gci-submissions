Note down any places you got stuck, problems or errors you ran into while doing this setup process.

> Step 3 in setting up a bot development environment was running ./tools/provision, and
I kept having difficulty installing the virtualenv package because I thought pip was in the wrong
folder. This isn't exactly specific to the setup, but ¯\_(.w.)_/¯

> Step 4 in running a bot was running zulip-run-bot helloworld --config-file <file-location>, but
my permission to access the file kept getting denied for some reason, no matter where I put the
file, so I copied it over to my remote server and tried to run it there. I had problems there too,
but that was only because I kept specifying the wrong file location :)

(Note: Since I set up the bot with the account Cordelia, I wasn't able to actually run the bot in
the "Verona" stream, so I just created my own stream and ran it there.)
