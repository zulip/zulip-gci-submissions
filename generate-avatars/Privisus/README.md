# Approach

I decided it would be a good idea to approach this problem 
mathematically. Boy I was in for a journey.

Then I thought about "periodic" things in math, I figured that a sine, cosine, and tangent would be fine to work with.

I also used PyPNG because it is small and relatively trivial to use and
understand.

(Note: PyPNG can be obtained via `curl -LO https://raw.github.com/drj11/pypng/master/code/png.py`)

# Process

I tried to experiment a little bit in Demos to see if it has a potential.
Something like this showed up:

![Desmos plot 1](https://lambda.sx/T2V.png "Desmos plot, first three enabled")

![Desmos plot 2](https://lambda.sx/KS3.png "Desmos plot, last three enabled")

Okay, looks promising, so I applied them into the program with few tweaks
here and there.

# Results

Results can be checked with the following command:

`avatar-1.png`: `python generate-identicons.py Alice`  
`avatar-2.png`: `python generate-identicons.py Bob`  
`avatar-3.png`: `python generate-identicons.py Marry`  
`avatar-4.png`: `python generate-identicons.py Zulip`
