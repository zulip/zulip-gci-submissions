Zulip Administration

A) Deactivate or Reactivate a User:-

Suggestions:-

1. The words "API Keys" can be hyperlinked to the API page as a first time user viewing the documents might not have an idea about the API Keys & their usage.
2. The word "bots" should also be hyperlinked to the respective 'Bots' documentation as a user might not have complete experience of using the Zulip Development Setup.

Questions:-
1. What if I have to Deactivate my account myself while also deactivating the API keys of the bots?(Without Making the User an Admin)
   Will I always have to tell the admin?

2. After Reactivating my account, will I get the API Keys of the bots(or the bots themselves) back to the stage prior to deactivation or will they have to be reconfigured?







B) Deactivate or Reactivate a Bot:-


Suggestions:-

1. A small image of a bot name stricken should be added to the page below the 3rd step of Deactivate A Bot, which will make understanding easier of how it works.

2. Same should be done for Reactivation of Bot, a screenshot of cleared Strikethrough should be added, or even better, a GIF, which will actually show what happens.



Questions:-

1. Can a User Privilege be created for Deactivation & Reactivation of bots?(Without Making the User an Admin) Or Do I Have to Contact the admin every time?
   If not, What can be done so that I can Deactivate the bots when I prefer without any delay?






C) Make a User an Administrator:-


Suggestions:-

1. Some sort of Security Measure should be added before making a user as an admin, as some users might misuse the privilege by deactivating others or their bots, which will result in loss of data and trust of the user.

2. Again, if possible, a small screenshot of the process of making a user an admin can be put up for better understanding of the reader.



Questions:-

1. Maximum how many admins can be there simultaneously? Or is there no such limit??







D)Change A User's Name:-


Suggestions:-

1. Some Security measure should be put out to prevent Admins from misusing their privileges of name changing, as it may cause the user harm/social embarrassment.



Questions:-

1. How many times can one change one's name?Is there such a limit?Are special characters allowed in the name?


Comments:-

1. Extra care should be taken to see that no admin misuses his/her privileges, but while doing so, no harm should go to the basic principles of the organization.


2. (If this feature is not present) The admin should have privileges to ban a user if he/she is using the platform for inappropriate & foul/vulgar conversations or comments. 

 






E)View All Bots In Your Organization:-



Suggestions:-

1. A screenshot of the Bots Tab can be inserted in the page to make understanding of the process more easy for a first time user.




Questions:-

1. What if I'm a user(not having admin privileges), but I still want to view the configuration of bots, how can I do it?
   Will I have to become an admin to do so??
